# Experiment 1: Recursive Depth First Search (DFS) from CSV

## Theory

Depth First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Representation:** An undirected, unweighted graph can be represented using an adjacency list, where each node has a list of its adjacent nodes.
*   **Recursion:** The recursive approach uses the function call stack to keep track of the visited nodes and the path taken.
*   **Visited Set:** To avoid cycles and redundant processing, a set or boolean array is used to keep track of nodes that have already been visited.
*   **CSV Input:** The graph structure (edges) is read from a Comma Separated Values (.csv) file. Each row typically represents an edge, listing the two nodes it connects.

**How it works (Recursive):**

1.  Start DFS from a given starting node.
2.  Mark the current node as visited.
3.  Process the current node (e.g., print it).
4.  For each neighbor of the current node:
    *   If the neighbor has not been visited, recursively call DFS on the neighbor.
5.  If the graph might be disconnected, iterate through all nodes and start DFS if a node hasn't been visited yet.

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
DFS(graph, start_node, visited):
  Mark start_node as visited
  Print start_node

  For each neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(start_node):
    If neighbor is not in visited:
      DFS(graph, neighbor, visited)

Main Function:
  Read graph data from CSV file
  Create adjacency list representation of the graph
  Initialize an empty set 'visited'
  Choose a starting node 'start'

  // Handle disconnected graphs (optional, depends on requirement)
  // For each node 'v' in graph:
  //   If 'v' is not in visited:
  //     DFS(graph, v, visited)

  // Assuming a connected graph or starting from a specific node:
  If start node exists in graph:
      DFS(graph, start, visited)
  Else:
      Print "Start node not found"
```

**To Run the Code:**

1.  Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `dfs_recursive_csv.py`).
2.  The code includes functionality to create a sample `graph.csv` file in the same directory if it doesn't exist. You can modify this CSV or create your own with the format:
    ```csv
    Node1,Node2
    A,B
    A,C
    B,D
    ...
    ```
3.  Run the script from your terminal: `python dfs_recursive_csv.py`
4.  The output will show the graph read from the CSV and the DFS traversal sequence.
