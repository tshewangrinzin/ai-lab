# Experiment 3: Breadth First Search (BFS) from User Input

## Theory

Breadth First Search (BFS) is another fundamental algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (source or root) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to visit.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Representation:** An undirected, unweighted graph is typically represented using an adjacency list.
*   **Queue:** A queue (First-In, First-Out) is used to manage the order of nodes to be visited. Nodes are added to the rear of the queue and removed from the front.
*   **Visited Set:** A set is used to keep track of nodes that have already been visited to avoid cycles and redundant processing. A node is marked visited when it's added to the queue.
*   **Level-by-Level Exploration:** BFS explores the graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges from the source node to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph.
*   **User Input:** The graph structure (nodes and edges) is provided by the user during runtime.

**How it works (Iterative):**

1.  Initialize an empty queue `Q` and an empty set `visited`.
2.  Choose a starting node `start_node`.
3.  Add `start_node` to `Q` and mark `start_node` as visited.
4.  While `Q` is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a node from `Q`. Let's call it `current_node`.
    b.  Process `current_node` (e.g., print it).
    c.  For each neighbor of `current_node`:
        i.  If the neighbor has not been visited:
            *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
            *   Enqueue the neighbor.
5.  If the graph might be disconnected, repeat the process starting from any unvisited node until all nodes are visited.

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
BFS(graph, start_node):
  Initialize an empty queue Q
  Initialize an empty set visited

  If start_node is not in graph:
      Print "Start node not found"
      Return

  Mark start_node as visited
  Enqueue start_node into Q

  While Q is not empty:
    current_node = Q.dequeue()
    Print current_node

    For each neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(current_node):
      If neighbor is not in visited:
        Mark neighbor as visited
        Enqueue neighbor into Q

Main Function:
  Initialize an empty graph (e.g., adjacency list)
  Ask user for the number of edges
  Loop for the number of edges:
    Ask user for the two nodes forming an edge (u, v)
    Add edge (u, v) and (v, u) to the graph // Undirected

  Ask user for the starting node 'start'

  BFS(graph, start)

  // Optional: Handle disconnected graphs by iterating through all known nodes
  // all_nodes = get_all_nodes(graph)
  // visited_bfs = set() // Maintain a separate visited set if calling BFS multiple times
  // for node in all_nodes:
  //   if node not in visited_bfs:
  //      BFS_component(graph, node, visited_bfs) // Modified BFS to use passed visited set
```

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `bfs_user.py`).
2.  Run it from the terminal: `python bfs_user.py`.
3.  The program will prompt you to enter the number of edges.
4.  Then, it will ask you to enter each edge (two node names separated by space).
5.  Finally, it will ask for the starting node for the BFS traversal.
6.  The output will show the graph and the sequence of nodes visited during the BFS, exploring level by level.
