# Experiment 4: Best First Search (Directed, Unweighted Graph, User Input)

## Theory

Best-First Search (BestFS) is an informed search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule or heuristic function. It typically uses a priority queue to manage the nodes to visit, prioritizing nodes that appear closer to the goal based on the heuristic estimate.

This specific variant is often referred to as **Greedy Best-First Search** because it greedily chooses the node that *appears* to be closest to the goal according to the heuristic, without considering the cost incurred so far to reach that node (unlike A* search).

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Representation:** A directed, unweighted graph can be represented using an adjacency list where each key (node) maps to a list of nodes it points to.
*   **Heuristic Function (h(n)):** An estimate of the cost from node `n` to the goal node. This value is provided by the user for each node.
*   **Priority Queue:** Used to store nodes to be explored, ordered by their heuristic values (lowest heuristic value has higher priority).
*   **Visited Set:** To prevent cycles and redundant exploration, a set keeps track of visited nodes.
*   **User Input:** The graph structure (directed edges) and the heuristic value for each node are provided by the user.

**How it works:**

1.  Initialize an empty priority queue `PQ` and an empty set `visited`.
2.  Get the start node and the goal node from the user.
3.  Get the heuristic value `h(start_node)` for the start node.
4.  Add the start node to `PQ` with its heuristic value as priority: `PQ.add(start_node, h(start_node))`.
5.  While `PQ` is not empty:
    a.  Extract the node with the lowest heuristic value from `PQ`. Let's call it `current_node`.
    b.  If `current_node` is the goal node, the path is found (though BestFS doesn't inherently store the path, it can be reconstructed if needed). Return success.
    c.  If `current_node` has already been visited, continue to the next iteration (this handles cycles and ensures efficiency).
    d.  Mark `current_node` as visited.
    e.  Process `current_node` (e.g., print it as part of the explored sequence).
    f.  For each neighbor of `current_node`:
        i.  If the neighbor has not been visited:
            *   Get the heuristic value `h(neighbor)` for the neighbor.
            *   Add the neighbor to `PQ` with its heuristic value as priority: `PQ.add(neighbor, h(neighbor))`.
6.  If the loop finishes and the goal was not reached, the goal is unreachable from the start node. Return failure.

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
Best_First_Search(graph, heuristics, start_node, goal_node):
  Initialize an empty priority queue PQ // Stores (heuristic_value, node)
  Initialize an empty set visited

  If start_node is not in graph or goal_node is not in graph:
      Print "Start or Goal node not found in graph"
      Return Failure

  Add (heuristics[start_node], start_node) to PQ

  While PQ is not empty:
    (h_value, current_node) = PQ.extract_min() // Get node with lowest heuristic

    If current_node is goal_node:
      Print "Goal reached!"
      // Optional: Print path if tracked
      Return Success

    If current_node is in visited:
      Continue // Already processed this node via a potentially better (though not relevant in greedy BestFS) or same path

    Mark current_node as visited
    Print "Visiting node:", current_node

    For each neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(current_node):
      If neighbor is not in visited:
        If neighbor is in heuristics:
            Add (heuristics[neighbor], neighbor) to PQ
        Else:
            Print "Warning: Heuristic not found for neighbor", neighbor
            // Decide how to handle: skip, assume infinity, assume 0?
            // Assuming skip for now

  Print "Goal not reachable"
  Return Failure

Main Function:
  Initialize an empty graph (e.g., directed adjacency list)
  Initialize an empty dictionary 'heuristics'
  Ask user for the number of nodes and edges

  // Get Nodes and Heuristics
  Loop for the number of nodes:
      Ask user for node name
      Ask user for heuristic value for this node
      Store in 'heuristics' dictionary

  // Get Edges (Directed)
  Loop for the number of edges:
      Ask user for the source and destination nodes forming a directed edge (u -> v)
      Add edge u -> v to the graph

  Ask user for the starting node 'start'
  Ask user for the goal node 'goal'

  Best_First_Search(graph, heuristics, start, goal)

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `bestfs_directed_user.py`).
2.  Run it from the terminal: `python bestfs_directed_user.py`.
3.  The program will first ask for the number of nodes, then the name and heuristic value for each node.
4.  Next, it will ask for the number of directed edges and then each edge (source destination).
5.  Finally, it will ask for the start and goal nodes.
6.  The output will show the graph, heuristics, and the sequence of nodes visited by the Best-First Search algorithm as it tries to reach the goal.
