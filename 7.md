# Experiment 7: Best First Search (Directed, Weighted Graph, User Input)

## Theory

Best-First Search (BestFS) is an informed search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the node deemed most promising based on a heuristic function `h(n)`. It uses a priority queue to manage nodes, prioritizing those with the lowest heuristic value (estimated cost to the goal).

This specific variant, often called **Greedy Best-First Search**, focuses *only* on the heuristic value `h(n)` for prioritization. Even though the graph is directed and weighted, the edge weights are *not* considered when deciding which node to explore next. The algorithm greedily chooses the path that looks best locally based on the heuristic, without regard to the actual cost accumulated so far.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Representation:** A directed, weighted graph is typically represented using an adjacency list where each entry stores the neighbor node and the weight of the directed edge leading to it (e.g., `graph[node] = [(neighbor1, weight1), (neighbor2, weight2), ...]`).
*   **Heuristic Function (h(n)):** An estimate of the cost from node `n` to the goal node. Provided by the user for each node.
*   **Priority Queue:** Stores nodes to be explored, ordered by their heuristic values (lowest `h(n)` has highest priority).
*   **Visited Set:** Prevents cycles and redundant exploration by keeping track of nodes already processed.
*   **User Input:** The graph structure (directed weighted edges) and the heuristic value for each node are provided by the user.

**How it works:**

1.  Initialize an empty priority queue `PQ` and an empty set `visited`.
2.  Get the start node and the goal node from the user.
3.  Get the heuristic value `h(start_node)` for the start node.
4.  Add the start node to `PQ` with its heuristic value as priority: `PQ.add(start_node, h(start_node))`.
5.  While `PQ` is not empty:
    a.  Extract the node with the lowest heuristic value from `PQ`. Call it `current_node`.
    b.  If `current_node` is the goal node, the search is successful. Return success.
    c.  If `current_node` is already in `visited`, continue (already processed).
    d.  Mark `current_node` as visited.
    e.  Process `current_node` (e.g., print it).
    f.  For each neighbor (and associated edge weight) of `current_node`:
        i.  If the neighbor has not been visited:
            *   Get the heuristic value `h(neighbor)`.
            *   Add the neighbor to `PQ` with its heuristic value as priority: `PQ.add(neighbor, h(neighbor))`.
6.  If the loop finishes and the goal was not reached, return failure.

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
Best_First_Search(graph, heuristics, start_node, goal_node):
  Initialize an empty priority queue PQ // Stores (heuristic_value, node)
  Initialize an empty set visited

  If start_node not in graph or goal_node not in graph:
      Print "Start or Goal node not found in graph"
      Return Failure
  If start_node not in heuristics or goal_node not in heuristics:
      Print "Heuristic value missing for Start or Goal node"
      Return Failure

  Add (heuristics[start_node], start_node) to PQ

  While PQ is not empty:
    (h_value, current_node) = PQ.extract_min() // Get node with lowest heuristic

    If current_node is goal_node:
      Print "Goal reached!"
      Return Success

    If current_node is in visited:
      Continue

    Mark current_node as visited
    Print "Visiting node:", current_node, "(h=", h_value, ")"

    // Iterate through neighbors (ignoring weights for priority)
    For each (neighbor, weight) in graph.get_neighbors(current_node):
      If neighbor is not in visited:
        If neighbor in heuristics:
            Add (heuristics[neighbor], neighbor) to PQ
        Else:
            Print "Warning: Heuristic not found for neighbor", neighbor
            // Skip or handle as needed

  Print "Goal not reachable"
  Return Failure

Main Function:
  Initialize an empty graph (e.g., directed weighted adjacency list)
  Initialize an empty dictionary 'heuristics'
  Ask user for the number of nodes and edges

  // Get Nodes and Heuristics
  Loop for the number of nodes:
      Ask user for node name
      Ask user for heuristic value for this node
      Store in 'heuristics' dictionary
      Add node to graph keys

  // Get Edges (Directed, Weighted)
  Loop for the number of edges:
      Ask user for source, destination, and weight (u, v, w)
      Add edge u -> (v, w) to the graph

  Ask user for the starting node 'start'
  Ask user for the goal node 'goal'

  Best_First_Search(graph, heuristics, start, goal)

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `bestfs_directed_weighted_user.py`).
2.  Run it from the terminal: `python bestfs_directed_weighted_user.py`.
3.  The program will ask for the number of nodes, then the name and heuristic value for each node.
4.  Next, it will ask for the number of directed weighted edges and then each edge (source destination weight).
5.  Finally, it will ask for the start and goal nodes.
6.  The output shows the graph (with weights), heuristics, and the sequence of nodes visited by Greedy Best-First Search. Remember, edge weights are ignored for prioritization.
