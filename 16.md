# Experiment 16: Min-Max Algorithm (Computer Loses or Draws)

## Theory

**Min-Max Algorithm:**

Min-Max is a recursive algorithm used in two-player, zero-sum games with perfect information to determine the optimal move. It explores the game tree, assuming both players play optimally.

*   **Players:** MAX (tries to maximize score) and MIN (tries to minimize score).
*   **Utility Function:** Assigns scores to terminal states. For Tic-Tac-Toe:
    *   +1 if the standard MAX player wins.
    *   -1 if the standard MIN player wins.
    *   0 for a draw.
*   **Goal: Computer Loses or Draws:**
    In this variation, the computer is programmed to play sub-optimally, specifically to *lose* or *draw*, but never win. This means the computer (let's still call it 'X' for consistency, but it's playing to *minimize* its own score according to the standard evaluation) should aim for the worst possible outcome for itself.

    To achieve this, we can flip the logic: The computer, when it's its turn, will choose the move that leads to the *minimum* possible score (according to the standard +1 for X win, -1 for O win evaluation), assuming the opponent (Human, 'O') plays to *maximize* that score.

    Essentially, the computer plays the role of the MIN player from the standard Min-Max perspective, while the human plays the role of the MAX player.

**Modified Logic:**

*   **Computer's Turn ('X'):** Choose the move that leads to the state with the *minimum* utility value (obtained from the Human's subsequent maximizing moves).
*   **Human's Turn ('O'):** Assume the human plays optimally to *maximize* their score (minimize the computer's score). Choose the move that leads to the state with the *maximum* utility value (obtained from the Computer's subsequent minimizing moves).

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
// Represents the board (e.g., 3x3 list of lists)
// Player symbols (e.g., 'X' for computer/MIN-acting, 'O' for human/MAX-acting)

Function evaluate(board):
  // Standard evaluation: +1 for 'X' win, -1 for 'O' win, 0 for draw
  If Computer ('X') has won:
    Return +1
  Else if Human ('O') has won:
    Return -1
  Else if Board is full:
    Return 0 // Draw
  Else:
    Return null // Game not over

// Note: is_computers_turn determines if we minimize or maximize
Function minimax_lose_or_draw(board, depth, is_computers_turn):
  score = evaluate(board)

  // Terminal state reached
  If score is not null:
    Return score

  If is_computers_turn: // Computer's turn ('X') - Aims to MINIMIZE the score
    worst_score = +infinity
    For each possible move on the board:
      Make the move for Computer ('X')
      // Recursively call for the opponent's turn (opponent maximizes)
      current_score = minimax_lose_or_draw(board, depth + 1, False)
      Undo the move
      worst_score = min(worst_score, current_score)
    Return worst_score

  Else: // Human's turn ('O') - Assumed to MAXIMIZE the score
    best_score = -infinity
    For each possible move on the board:
      Make the move for Human ('O')
      // Recursively call for the computer's turn (computer minimizes)
      current_score = minimax_lose_or_draw(board, depth + 1, True)
      Undo the move
      best_score = max(best_score, current_score)
    Return best_score

Function find_worst_move_for_computer(board):
  worst_score = +infinity
  worst_move = null // (row, col)

  For each possible move (row, col) on the board:
    If cell (row, col) is empty:
      Make the move for Computer ('X')
      // Evaluate based on the opponent (Human) trying to maximize
      move_score = minimax_lose_or_draw(board, 0, False)
      Undo the move

      // Computer chooses the move leading to the minimum score
      If move_score < worst_score:
        worst_score = move_score
        worst_move = (row, col)
      // Optional: If scores are equal, maybe add randomness or pick first found

  // Handle case where no move found (shouldn't happen if board not full)
  If worst_move is null and board is not full:
      Find any valid empty cell as fallback

  Return worst_move

Main Game Loop:
  Initialize empty board
  Decide who goes first (e.g., Human)

  While game is not over:
    If it's Computer's turn ('X'):
      (row, col) = find_worst_move_for_computer(board)
      Make move at (row, col) for Computer ('X')
    Else (Human's turn 'O'):
      Get valid move (row, col) from Human input
      Make move at (row, col) for Human ('O')

    Print the board
    Check if game has ended (evaluate(board) is not null)

  Declare winner or draw based on evaluate(board)

**Explanation:**

1.  **Evaluation:** The `evaluate` function remains the same, providing a standard score (+1 for X win, -1 for O win, 0 for draw).
2.  **`minimax_lose_or_draw`:** This is the core change. When `is_computers_turn` is `True`, the function seeks the *minimum* score (`worst_val = min(...)`). When it's the human's turn (`False`), it assumes the human plays optimally to *maximize* the score (`best_val = max(...)`).
3.  **`find_worst_move_for_computer`:** This function iterates through possible moves for the computer ('X'). For each move, it calls `minimax_lose_or_draw` starting from the opponent's perspective (`is_computers_turn=False`) to see the outcome if the opponent plays to maximize. The computer then chooses the move (`worst_move`) that resulted in the *minimum* evaluated score (`worst_val`).
4.  **Game Loop:** The structure is similar to Experiment 15, but the computer now calls `find_worst_move_for_computer` to make its decision. The human is assumed to play normally (trying to win).

This setup forces the computer to select moves that, assuming the human plays optimally to win, will lead to the worst possible outcome for the computer (a loss or a draw).
