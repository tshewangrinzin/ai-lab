# Experiment 5: Best First Search (Undirected, Weighted Graph, User Input)

## Theory

Best-First Search (BestFS) is an informed search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the node deemed most promising according to a heuristic function. It uses a priority queue to prioritize nodes based on their heuristic estimate, aiming to find a path to the goal node efficiently.

This variant, often called **Greedy Best-First Search**, focuses solely on the heuristic value `h(n)` (estimated cost from node `n` to the goal) to decide which node to explore next. It does *not* consider the actual cost `g(n)` (cost from the start node to `n`) incurred so far. Even though the graph is weighted, these weights are not used by the standard Greedy Best-First Search algorithm for prioritization; only the heuristic values matter.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Representation:** An undirected, weighted graph can be represented using an adjacency list where each entry stores not only the neighbor but also the weight of the edge connecting them (e.g., `graph[node] = [(neighbor1, weight1), (neighbor2, weight2), ...]`).
*   **Heuristic Function (h(n)):** An estimate of the cost from node `n` to the goal node. Provided by the user for each node.
*   **Priority Queue:** Stores nodes to be explored, ordered by their heuristic values (lowest `h(n)` has highest priority).
*   **Visited Set:** Prevents cycles and redundant exploration.
*   **User Input:** The graph structure (undirected weighted edges) and the heuristic value for each node are provided by the user.

**How it works:**

1.  Initialize an empty priority queue `PQ` and an empty set `visited`.
2.  Get the start node and the goal node from the user.
3.  Get the heuristic value `h(start_node)` for the start node.
4.  Add the start node to `PQ` with its heuristic value as priority: `PQ.add(start_node, h(start_node))`.
5.  While `PQ` is not empty:
    a.  Extract the node with the lowest heuristic value from `PQ`. Let's call it `current_node`.
    b.  If `current_node` is the goal node, the path is found. Return success.
    c.  If `current_node` has already been visited, continue.
    d.  Mark `current_node` as visited.
    e.  Process `current_node` (e.g., print it).
    f.  For each neighbor of `current_node` (obtained from the weighted adjacency list):
        i.  If the neighbor has not been visited:
            *   Get the heuristic value `h(neighbor)`.
            *   Add the neighbor to `PQ` with its heuristic value as priority: `PQ.add(neighbor, h(neighbor))`.
6.  If the loop finishes and the goal was not reached, return failure.

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
Best_First_Search(graph, heuristics, start_node, goal_node):
  Initialize an empty priority queue PQ // Stores (heuristic_value, node)
  Initialize an empty set visited

  If start_node is not in graph or goal_node is not in graph:
      Print "Start or Goal node not found in graph"
      Return Failure

  Add (heuristics[start_node], start_node) to PQ

  While PQ is not empty:
    (h_value, current_node) = PQ.extract_min() // Get node with lowest heuristic

    If current_node is goal_node:
      Print "Goal reached!"
      Return Success

    If current_node is in visited:
      Continue

    Mark current_node as visited
    Print "Visiting node:", current_node

    // Iterate through neighbors (ignoring weights for priority)
    For each (neighbor, weight) in graph.get_neighbors(current_node):
      If neighbor is not in visited:
        If neighbor in heuristics:
            Add (heuristics[neighbor], neighbor) to PQ
        Else:
            Print "Warning: Heuristic not found for neighbor", neighbor
            // Skip or handle as needed

  Print "Goal not reachable"
  Return Failure

Main Function:
  Initialize an empty graph (e.g., weighted adjacency list)
  Initialize an empty dictionary 'heuristics'
  Ask user for the number of nodes and edges

  // Get Nodes and Heuristics
  Loop for the number of nodes:
      Ask user for node name
      Ask user for heuristic value for this node
      Store in 'heuristics' dictionary

  // Get Edges (Undirected, Weighted)
  Loop for the number of edges:
      Ask user for the two nodes and the weight (u, v, w)
      Add edge (u, v, w) and (v, u, w) to the graph

  Ask user for the starting node 'start'
  Ask user for the goal node 'goal'

  Best_First_Search(graph, heuristics, start, goal)
```

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `bestfs_undirected_weighted_user.py`).
2.  Run it from the terminal: `python bestfs_undirected_weighted_user.py`.
3.  The program will ask for the number of nodes, then the name and heuristic value for each node.
4.  Next, it will ask for the number of undirected weighted edges and then each edge (node1 node2 weight).
5.  Finally, it will ask for the start and goal nodes.
6.  The output shows the graph (with weights), heuristics, and the sequence of nodes visited by Greedy Best-First Search. Remember, the edge weights are ignored during the search prioritization.
