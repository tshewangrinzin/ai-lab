# Experiment 2: Non-Recursive Depth First Search (DFS) from User Input

## Theory

Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Unlike the recursive version which uses the function call stack implicitly, the non-recursive (or iterative) version explicitly uses a stack data structure to keep track of the nodes to visit.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Representation:** An undirected, unweighted graph is typically represented using an adjacency list (a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of their neighbors).
*   **Stack:** A stack (Last-In, First-Out) is used to manage the order of nodes to be visited. When a node is visited, its unvisited neighbors are pushed onto the stack.
*   **Visited Set:** A set is used to keep track of nodes that have already been visited to prevent cycles and redundant processing.
*   **User Input:** The graph structure (nodes and edges) is provided by the user during runtime.

**How it works (Non-Recursive/Iterative):**

1.  Initialize an empty stack and an empty set `visited`.
2.  Choose a starting node and push it onto the stack.
3.  While the stack is not empty:
    a.  Pop a node from the stack. Let's call it `current_node`.
    b.  If `current_node` has not been visited:
        i.  Mark `current_node` as visited.
        ii. Process `current_node` (e.g., print it).
        iii. For each neighbor of `current_node`:
            *   If the neighbor has not been visited, push it onto the stack.
4.  If the graph might be disconnected, repeat the process starting from any unvisited node until all nodes are visited.

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
DFS_Iterative(graph, start_node):
  Initialize an empty stack S
  Initialize an empty set visited

  Push start_node onto S

  While S is not empty:
    current_node = S.pop()

    If current_node is not in visited:
      Mark current_node as visited
      Print current_node

      // Push neighbors in reverse order if specific traversal order matters,
      // otherwise, the order doesn't strictly matter for correctness.
      For each neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(current_node):
        If neighbor is not in visited:
          Push neighbor onto S

Main Function:
  Initialize an empty graph (e.g., adjacency list)
  Ask user for the number of edges
  Loop for the number of edges:
    Ask user for the two nodes forming an edge (u, v)
    Add edge (u, v) and (v, u) to the graph // Undirected

  Ask user for the starting node 'start'

  If start node exists in graph:
      DFS_Iterative(graph, start)
  Else:
      Print "Start node not found"

  // Optional: Handle disconnected graphs by iterating through all known nodes
  // all_nodes = get_all_nodes(graph)
  // for node in all_nodes:
  //   if node not in visited:
  //      DFS_Iterative(graph, node) // Need to manage visited set across calls
```

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `dfs_iterative_user.py`).
2.  Run it from the terminal: `python dfs_iterative_user.py`.
3.  The program will prompt you to enter the number of edges.
4.  Then, it will ask you to enter each edge (two node names separated by space).
5.  Finally, it will ask for the starting node for the DFS traversal.
6.  The output will show the graph and the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS.
