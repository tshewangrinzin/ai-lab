# Experiment 8: A* Algorithm (Directed, Weighted Graph, CSV Input)

## Theory

A* (pronounced "A-star") is an informed search algorithm, widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. It efficiently finds the least-cost path between a given initial node and one goal node (out of one or more possible goals).

A* maintains a priority queue of paths to be explored. It prioritizes paths based on a cost function `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`:

*   **g(n):** The actual cost of the path from the start node to node `n` found so far.
*   **h(n):** The heuristic estimate of the cost from node `n` to the goal node. This heuristic must be **admissible** (never overestimates the actual cost) for A* to guarantee finding the optimal path. If it's also **consistent** (monotonic), A* runs more efficiently.
*   **f(n):** The estimated total cost of the path through node `n`.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Representation:** A directed, weighted graph is represented using an adjacency list where each entry stores the neighbor and the weight (cost) of the directed edge: `graph[node] = [(neighbor1, weight1), (neighbor2, weight2), ...]`).
*   **Heuristic Function (h(n)):** An admissible estimate of the cost from `n` to the goal. Read from a CSV file along with the graph structure.
*   **Priority Queue:** Stores nodes to visit, prioritized by their `f(n)` value (lowest `f(n)` first).
*   **Cost Tracking (g(n)):** A dictionary or map stores the minimum cost found so far to reach each node from the start.
*   **Visited/Closed Set:** Often implicitly handled by checking if a node's cost `g(n)` can be improved. A separate closed set can also be used to track fully processed nodes.
*   **Parent Pointers:** To reconstruct the final path once the goal is reached.
*   **CSV Input:** Both the graph structure (directed edges with weights) and the heuristic values for nodes are read from CSV files.

**How it works:**

1.  Initialize: Create a priority queue `open_set`, dictionaries `g_cost` (initialized to infinity for all nodes except start), `f_cost` (calculated using `g_cost` and `h`), and `parent`.
2.  Start: Set `g_cost[start_node] = 0`, calculate `f_cost[start_node] = h(start_node)`, and add `(f_cost[start_node], start_node)` to `open_set`.
3.  Loop: While `open_set` is not empty:
    a.  Extract the node `current_node` with the lowest `f_cost` from `open_set`.
    b.  If `current_node` is the goal node, reconstruct and return the path using `parent` pointers.
    c.  For each `neighbor` of `current_node` with edge weight `weight`:
        i.  Calculate `tentative_g_cost = g_cost[current_node] + weight`.
        ii. If `tentative_g_cost < g_cost[neighbor]` (meaning a better path to `neighbor` is found):
            *   Update `parent[neighbor] = current_node`.
            *   Update `g_cost[neighbor] = tentative_g_cost`.
            *   Calculate `f_cost[neighbor] = g_cost[neighbor] + h(neighbor)`.
            *   If `neighbor` is not already in `open_set` (or if using a structure that allows updates), add `(f_cost[neighbor], neighbor)` to `open_set`.
4.  If the loop finishes and the goal was not reached, return failure (goal unreachable).

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
function reconstruct_path(parent, current):
    total_path = [current]
    while current in parent:
        current = parent[current]
        total_path.append(current)
    return total_path reversed

A_Star(graph, heuristics, start_node, goal_node):
    Initialize open_set as a priority queue // Stores (f_cost, node)
    Initialize parent = empty map // Stores parent pointers for path reconstruction
    Initialize g_cost = map with default value infinity
    Initialize f_cost = map with default value infinity

    g_cost[start_node] = 0
    f_cost[start_node] = heuristics[start_node]
    Add (f_cost[start_node], start_node) to open_set

    While open_set is not empty:
        (current_f, current_node) = open_set.extract_min()

        If current_node is goal_node:
            Return reconstruct_path(parent, current_node)

        // Optimization: If we extract a node already processed with a lower f_cost,
        // skip it. This depends on how duplicates are handled in the priority queue.

        For each (neighbor, weight) in graph.get_neighbors(current_node):
            tentative_g_cost = g_cost[current_node] + weight

            If tentative_g_cost < g_cost[neighbor]:
                // This path to neighbor is better than any previous one.
                parent[neighbor] = current_node
                g_cost[neighbor] = tentative_g_cost
                f_cost[neighbor] = g_cost[neighbor] + heuristics[neighbor]

                // Check if neighbor is in open_set; if not, add it.
                // If it is, update its priority if the priority queue supports it.
                // A simple approach is to just add it again; the check at extraction handles duplicates.
                Add (f_cost[neighbor], neighbor) to open_set

    Return Failure // Goal was not reached

Main Function:
    Read graph data (directed edges with weights) from graph_csv_file
    Read heuristic values from heuristics_csv_file
    Create graph representation (adjacency list)
    Store heuristics in a dictionary

    Define start_node and goal_node

    path = A_Star(graph, heuristics, start_node, goal_node)

    If path is not Failure:
        Print "Path found:", path
    Else:
        Print "Path not found"

**To Run the Code:**

1.  Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `a_star_csv.py`).
2.  The code includes functionality to create sample `graph_directed_weighted.csv` and `heuristics.csv` files in the same directory.
    *   `graph_directed_weighted.csv` format: `Source,Destination,Weight` (one edge per row).
    *   `heuristics.csv` format: `Node,Heuristic` (one node per row).
3.  You can modify these CSV files or create your own with the specified formats.
4.  Run the script from your terminal: `python a_star_csv.py`.
5.  The script will prompt you to confirm or enter the start and goal nodes.
6.  The output will show the graph, heuristics, the nodes visited during the A* search (with their f, g, h costs), and the final optimal path found (if any) along with its total cost.
