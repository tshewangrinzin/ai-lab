# Experiment 9: A* Algorithm (Directed, Weighted Graph, User Input)

## Theory

A* (A-star) is an informed search algorithm used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It combines the strengths of Dijkstra's algorithm (which finds the shortest path based on actual cost from the start) and Greedy Best-First Search (which uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to the goal).

A* prioritizes nodes based on the evaluation function `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`:

*   **g(n):** The actual cost of the path found so far from the start node to node `n`.
*   **h(n):** The heuristic estimate of the cost from node `n` to the goal node. For A* to guarantee optimality (finding the true shortest path), the heuristic must be **admissible** (it never overestimates the actual cost to the goal).
*   **f(n):** The estimated total cost of the path from start to goal going through node `n`.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Representation:** A directed, weighted graph is represented using an adjacency list: `graph[node] = [(neighbor1, weight1), (neighbor2, weight2), ...]`, where `weight` is the cost of the directed edge.
*   **Heuristic Function (h(n)):** An admissible estimate of the cost from `n` to the goal. Provided by the user.
*   **Priority Queue (Open Set):** Stores nodes to be explored, prioritized by their `f(n)` value (lowest `f(n)` first).
*   **Cost Tracking (g(n)):** A dictionary stores the minimum cost found so far to reach each node from the start.
*   **Parent Pointers:** A dictionary stores the predecessor of each node on the best path found so far, used to reconstruct the final path.
*   **Closed Set (Implicit/Explicit):** Keeps track of nodes already processed to avoid redundant work. Often handled implicitly by checking if a newly found path to a node is better than a previous one.
*   **User Input:** The graph structure (nodes, directed weighted edges) and heuristic values are provided by the user during runtime.

**How it works:**

1.  Initialize: Create a priority queue `open_set`, dictionaries `g_cost` (infinity except start), `f_cost` (infinity except start), and `parent`.
2.  Start: Set `g_cost[start_node] = 0`, `f_cost[start_node] = h(start_node)`, add `(f_cost[start_node], start_node)` to `open_set`.
3.  Loop: While `open_set` is not empty:
    a.  Extract `current_node` with the lowest `f_cost` from `open_set`.
    b.  If `current_node` is the goal, reconstruct and return the path.
    c.  For each `neighbor` of `current_node` with edge weight `weight`:
        i.  Calculate `tentative_g_cost = g_cost[current_node] + weight`.
        ii. If `tentative_g_cost < g_cost[neighbor]`:
            *   Update `parent[neighbor] = current_node`.
            *   Update `g_cost[neighbor] = tentative_g_cost`.
            *   Calculate `f_cost[neighbor] = g_cost[neighbor] + h(neighbor)`.
            *   Add `(f_cost[neighbor], neighbor)` to `open_set` (or update if already present and priority queue supports it).
4.  If loop finishes, return failure (goal unreachable).

function reconstruct_path(parent, current):
    total_path = [current]
    while current in parent:
        current = parent[current]

    Initialize open_set as a priority queue // Stores (f_cost, node)
    Initialize parent = empty map

    Initialize f_cost = map with default value infinity

    g_cost[start_node] = 0
    f_cost[start_node] = heuristics[start_node]
    Add (f_cost[start_node], start_node) to open_set

    While open_set is not empty:
        (current_f, current_node) = open_set.extract_min()

        If current_node is goal_node:
            Return reconstruct_path(parent, current_node)

        // Optimization: If current_f > f_cost[current_node], skip (already found better path)
        if current_f > f_cost[current_node]:
            continue

        For each (neighbor, weight) in graph.get_neighbors(current_node):
            tentative_g_cost = g_cost[current_node] + weight

            If tentative_g_cost < g_cost[neighbor]:
                parent[neighbor] = current_node
                g_cost[neighbor] = tentative_g_cost
                f_cost[neighbor] = g_cost[neighbor] + heuristics[neighbor]
                Add (f_cost[neighbor], neighbor) to open_set

    Return Failure // Goal not reached

Main Function:
    Initialize graph, heuristics, nodes set
    Ask user for number of nodes
    Loop for number of nodes:
        Get node name and heuristic value
        Store node and heuristic

    Ask user for number of directed weighted edges
    Loop for number of edges:
        Get source, destination, weight
        Add edge to graph

    Ask user for start node and goal node

    path = A_Star(graph, heuristics, start_node, goal_node)

    If path is not Failure:
        Print "Path found:", path, "Cost:", g_cost[goal_node]
    Else:
        Print "Path not found"

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `a_star_user.py`).
2.  Run it from the terminal: `python a_star_user.py`.
3.  The program will prompt you for:
    *   Number of nodes.
    *   Name and heuristic value for each node.
    *   Number of directed weighted edges.
    *   Source, destination, and weight for each edge.
    *   Start node.
    *   Goal node.
4.  The output will show the graph details, the steps of the A* search (visited nodes and costs), and the final optimal path and its cost if found.
