# Experiment 15: Min-Max Algorithm (Computer Wins or Draws)

## Theory

**Min-Max Algorithm:**

Min-Max is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player, zero-sum games (like Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Nim) where players have perfect information. The goal is to find the optimal move for a player, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.

*   **Zero-Sum Game:** One player's gain is the other player's loss.
*   **Players:** Typically referred to as MAX (the player trying to maximize the score, often the AI) and MIN (the player trying to minimize the score, often the human opponent).
*   **Game Tree:** The game states are represented as nodes in a tree. The root is the current state, and children represent states reachable after one move.
*   **Utility Function:** Assigns a numerical score to terminal states (end-game states). For Tic-Tac-Toe:
    *   +1 if MAX (Computer) wins.
    *   -1 if MIN (Human) wins.
    *   0 for a draw.
*   **Recursive Exploration:** The algorithm explores the game tree recursively.
    *   **MAX Player's Turn:** Chooses the move that leads to the state with the *maximum* utility value (obtained from the MIN player's subsequent moves).
    *   **MIN Player's Turn:** Chooses the move that leads to the state with the *minimum* utility value (obtained from the MAX player's subsequent moves).

**Goal: Computer Wins or Draws**

To ensure the computer (MAX) always wins or draws, the Min-Max algorithm explores all possible game outcomes from the current state. By always choosing the move that maximizes its potential score (assuming the opponent minimizes it), the computer guarantees the best possible outcome for itself, which, in a perfectly played game like Tic-Tac-Toe from the start, is at least a draw.

**Tic-Tac-Toe Specifics:**

*   **State:** The 3x3 board configuration.
*   **Moves:** Placing the player's mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
*   **Terminal States:** Board is full (draw), or one player has three marks in a row/column/diagonal (win/loss).

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
// Represents the board (e.g., 3x3 list of lists)
// Player symbols (e.g., 'X' for computer/MAX, 'O' for human/MIN)

Function evaluate(board):
  // Check rows, columns, diagonals for a win
  If Computer ('X') has won:
    Return +1
  Else if Human ('O') has won:
    Return -1
  Else if Board is full (no empty cells):
    Return 0 // Draw
  Else:
    Return null // Game not over

Function minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing_player):
  score = evaluate(board)

  // Terminal state reached
  If score is not null:
    Return score

  If is_maximizing_player: // Computer's turn (MAX)
    best_score = -infinity
    For each possible move on the board:
      Make the move for Computer ('X')
      // Recursively call minimax for the opponent's turn
      current_score = minimax(board, depth + 1, False)
      Undo the move
      best_score = max(best_score, current_score)
    Return best_score

  Else: // Human's turn (MIN)
    best_score = +infinity
    For each possible move on the board:
      Make the move for Human ('O')
      // Recursively call minimax for the computer's turn
      current_score = minimax(board, depth + 1, True)
      Undo the move
      best_score = min(best_score, current_score)
    Return best_score

Function find_best_move(board):
  best_score = -infinity
  best_move = null // (row, col)

  For each possible move (row, col) on the board:
    If cell (row, col) is empty:
      Make the move for Computer ('X')
      move_score = minimax(board, 0, False) // Start recursion for MIN player
      Undo the move

      If move_score > best_score:
        best_score = move_score
        best_move = (row, col)

  Return best_move

Main Game Loop:
  Initialize empty board
  Decide who goes first (e.g., Computer)

  While game is not over:
    If it's Computer's turn:
      (row, col) = find_best_move(board)
      Make move at (row, col) for Computer ('X')
    Else (Human's turn):
      Get valid move (row, col) from Human input
      Make move at (row, col) for Human ('O')

    Print the board
    Check if game has ended (evaluate(board) is not null)

  Declare winner or draw based on evaluate(board)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Board Representation:** A 3x3 list of lists stores the game state (`EMPTY`, `COMPUTER`, `HUMAN`).
2.  **`evaluate(board)`:** Checks if the current board state is a terminal state (win, loss, draw) and returns the corresponding score (+1, -1, 0) or `None` if the game continues.
3.  **`minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing)`:** The core recursive function. It explores possible moves:
    *   If `is_maximizing` (Computer's turn), it tries all empty cells, makes the move, recursively calls `minimax` for the minimizing player, undoes the move, and returns the maximum score found.
    *   If not `is_maximizing` (Human's turn), it does the same but returns the minimum score found.
4.  **`find_best_move(board)`:** Iterates through all empty cells, simulates placing the computer's mark, calls `minimax` to evaluate the outcome assuming the opponent plays optimally (minimizing), undoes the move, and chooses the move that resulted in the highest evaluated score.
5.  **Game Loop:** Alternates turns between the computer and the human. The computer uses `find_best_move` to select its move. The human provides input. The loop continues until `evaluate` returns a non-`None` score.

This implementation ensures the computer plays optimally according to the Min-Max algorithm, guaranteeing it will either win or draw if it plays perfectly from any state.
