# Experiment 6: Best First Search (Undirected, Unweighted Graph, User Input)

## Theory

Best-First Search (BestFS) is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide its exploration of a graph. It prioritizes expanding nodes that appear to be closest to the goal, based on the heuristic estimate. The specific variant used here is often called **Greedy Best-First Search**.

In this case, we are dealing with an undirected, unweighted graph. This means edges have no direction (if A is connected to B, B is connected to A) and all edges are considered to have a uniform cost (typically 1, though this cost isn't used by Greedy BestFS for prioritization).

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph Representation:** An undirected, unweighted graph is usually represented using an adjacency list (e.g., a dictionary mapping each node to a list of its neighbors).
*   **Heuristic Function (h(n)):** An estimate of the cost or distance from node `n` to the goal node. This value is provided by the user for each node.
*   **Priority Queue:** A data structure (often implemented with a min-heap) used to store nodes to be explored. Nodes are ordered based on their heuristic values, with the lowest heuristic value having the highest priority.
*   **Visited Set:** A set used to keep track of nodes that have already been visited to avoid redundant processing and infinite loops in graphs with cycles.
*   **User Input:** The graph structure (nodes and undirected edges) and the heuristic value for each node are provided by the user at runtime.

**How it works (Greedy Best-First Search):**

1.  Initialize an empty priority queue `PQ` and an empty set `visited`.
2.  Get the start node and the goal node from the user.
3.  Get the heuristic value `h(start_node)` for the start node.
4.  Add the start node to `PQ` with its heuristic value as priority: `PQ.add(start_node, h(start_node))`.
5.  While `PQ` is not empty:
    a.  Extract the node with the lowest heuristic value from `PQ`. Call it `current_node`.
    b.  If `current_node` is the goal node, the search is successful. Return success.
    c.  If `current_node` is already in `visited`, skip it and continue to the next iteration.
    d.  Mark `current_node` as visited.
    e.  Process `current_node` (e.g., print it).
    f.  For each neighbor of `current_node`:
        i.  If the neighbor has not been visited:
            *   Get the heuristic value `h(neighbor)` for the neighbor.
            *   Add the neighbor to `PQ` with its heuristic value as priority: `PQ.add(neighbor, h(neighbor))`.
6.  If the loop finishes (PQ becomes empty) and the goal was not reached, the goal is unreachable from the start node. Return failure.

## Pseudocode/Algorithm

```
Best_First_Search(graph, heuristics, start_node, goal_node):
  Initialize an empty priority queue PQ // Stores (heuristic_value, node)
  Initialize an empty set visited

  If start_node is not in graph or goal_node is not in graph:
      Print "Start or Goal node not found in graph"
      Return Failure
  If start_node not in heuristics or goal_node not in heuristics:
      Print "Heuristic value missing for Start or Goal node"
      Return Failure

  Add (heuristics[start_node], start_node) to PQ

  While PQ is not empty:
    (h_value, current_node) = PQ.extract_min() // Get node with lowest heuristic

    If current_node is goal_node:
      Print "Goal reached!"
      // Optional: Reconstruct and print path if tracked
      Return Success

    If current_node is in visited:
      Continue

    Mark current_node as visited
    Print "Visiting node:", current_node, "(h=", h_value, ")"

    For each neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(current_node):
      If neighbor is not in visited:
        If neighbor in heuristics:
            Add (heuristics[neighbor], neighbor) to PQ
        Else:
            Print "Warning: Heuristic not found for neighbor", neighbor
            // Skip or handle as needed

  Print "Goal not reachable"
  Return Failure

Main Function:
  Initialize an empty graph (e.g., adjacency list for unweighted)
  Initialize an empty dictionary 'heuristics'
  Ask user for the number of nodes and edges

  // Get Nodes and Heuristics
  Loop for the number of nodes:
      Ask user for node name
      Ask user for heuristic value for this node
      Store in 'heuristics' dictionary
      Add node to graph keys (even if isolated initially)

  // Get Edges (Undirected, Unweighted)
  Loop for the number of edges:
      Ask user for the two nodes forming an edge (u, v)
      Add edge u -> v and v -> u to the graph

  Ask user for the starting node 'start'
  Ask user for the goal node 'goal'

  Best_First_Search(graph, heuristics, start, goal)

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `bestfs_undirected_unweighted_user.py`).
2.  Run it from the terminal: `python bestfs_undirected_unweighted_user.py`.
3.  The program will ask for the number of nodes, then the name and heuristic value for each node.
4.  Next, it will ask for the number of undirected unweighted edges and then each edge (node1 node2).
5.  Finally, it will ask for the start and goal nodes.
6.  The output shows the graph, heuristics, and the sequence of nodes visited by Greedy Best-First Search.
